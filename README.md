## Web Project in CAU - The Wall

This project is using fullstack JS technologies

### Front:

In the folder front, you will find the all website project in Angular 2+. [Angular 2+](https://cli.angular.io/) is using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and we are using some modules with angular like [Bootstrap module](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home) and [Material module](https://material.angular.io/).  
See the README in this folder to check how to run the website.

### Back

In the folder api, you will find the all api project that the website need to work properly.  
We are using the Framework [FeathersJS](https://feathersjs.com/) to create a powerful and realtime REST API.

### How to test all in the same time ?

Pretty simple ! We put everything on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) that let us put some instance of the website and the api up to test.  Please try the [website]().
